# A simple set of reusable CSS styles for creating buttons

Create beautiful CSS3 buttons by simply mixing and matching Structures i.e. the base styles of a button, with Skins i.e. the look and feel of a button.

This project is inspired by Nicole Sullivan's Object Oriented CSS (OOCSS).

For examples, take a look at <code>index.html</code>.
